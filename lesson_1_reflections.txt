>>>>>> How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows parts of files with line numbers,
    where the differences were found. It is more easy
    to find the placed in the document after this.

>>>>>> How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can find when and by whom some part of code was changed
You can come back to an old version if needed, like in case when you removed something


>>>>>> What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Commits will have a logical meaning, they will be logically completed. 
They can have appropriate size: not too small (when you have many small commits, you will
have long history for a small period of time) and not to big (when its hard to
analize a differeence between 2 versions)

>>>>>> Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because one logical functionality may be implemented in more than 1 file
And when you change something in this functionality (like add new functiona parameter)
you change more than 1 file.

>>>>>> How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log - see history of commits, you may find needed commit by the comment 
(that's why comment must be meaningful)
got diff <commit id1> <commit id2> - see difference between 2 commits

>>>>>> How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You may chekout previous commit(s) to find the one which contains code causeng an issue
You may find the exact code changes that could cause an issue - using git diff to compare first commit
where bug appeared with previous commit 

>>>>>>> Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Try to use commands, that I've learned: log, diff, clone, checkout
    Try to find bugs in some code
