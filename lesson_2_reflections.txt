>>>>What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

file .git gets created. We need to do this to make a repository methadata 
to be created to store commits history

>>>> How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate level between repository and working directory
It allows to include more than one file into a commit. This group of files
will correspond to one logical unit of functionality and you may 
add one commit message explaining the purpose of this commit.
